# PowerShell ♥️ VSCode by @TylerLeonhardt

Checkout PowerShellLive on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/PowerShellLive)!

We talked about a bunch of different features of the PowerShell extension for VSCode.

Remember - `ctrl`+`shift`+`p` is you friend! That's the command pallet.

If you have any issues with the extension, do `ctrl`+`shift`+`p` and type "PowerShell Bug".

Here is a collection of links of some of the things I touched on.
