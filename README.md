DuPSUG 14 – Valentine’s Day Edition

## **About DuPSUG 14**

This is an evening edition of our user group. This means we will start off with a quick bite to eat for our attendees and speakers. We have an evening with diverse and advanced topics prepared for you presented by experienced speakers. If you would like to attend please register through Eventbrite to reserve your seat, as we have limited seats available.

## **Speakers**

As a special guest we will have [Tyler Leonhardt](https://twitter.com/TylerLeonhardt) from the Microsoft PowerShell Team, and he is a major maintainer of the PowerShell extension for our favorite code editor, VSCode. [Jaap Brasser](https://twitter.com/jaap_brasser) & [Mathias Jessen](https://www.twitter.com/iisresetme) will talk about the state of PowerShell 6, community contributions and upcoming PowerShell events.
